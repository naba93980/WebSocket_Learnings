Using WebSocket as a transport refers to utilizing the WebSocket protocol as a means of communication or transport layer for data exchange between client and server applications over the Internet.

WebSocket allows for real-time, event-driven communication between client and server.

Using WebSocket as a transport can involve implementing WebSocket in both the client-side and server-side applications, using libraries or frameworks that provide WebSocket support, and adhering to the WebSocket protocol specification.

In the server-side usage of Socket.IO, a socket object represents a connection to a specific client that is connected to the server. It provides methods and events that allow the server to send data to the connected client and receive data from the client, as well as handle various events, such as when a client connects or disconnects.

In the client-side usage of Socket.IO, a socket object represents the connection from the client to the server. It provides methods and events that allow the client to send data to the server and receive data from the server, as well as handle various events, such as when the connection is established or disconnected.
